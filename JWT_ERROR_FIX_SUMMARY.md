# JWT Authentication Error Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The application was returning a 500 Internal Server Error when the centralized JWT service (running on port 8091) was not available. This occurred because:

1. The application was configured to use a centralized JWT service by default
2. When the centralized service was unreachable, the fallback mechanism was not working properly
3. Exception handling was incomplete, causing unhandled runtime exceptions

## Root Causes
1. **Incomplete fallback logic** in `AuthController.java` - the try-catch block was missing the fallback implementation
2. **Poor exception handling** in JWT service client communication
3. **Missing global exception handler** for JWT service specific exceptions
4. **Insufficient error handling** in the authentication filter

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced AuthController.java
- ✅ Fixed incomplete fallback logic in token generation
- ✅ Added proper exception handling for JWT service failures
- ✅ Improved error responses with detailed logging

### 2. Improved JwtAuthenticationFilter.java
- ✅ Enhanced error handling during token validation
- ✅ Added proper fallback to local validation when centralized service fails
- ✅ Added actuator endpoints to public endpoint exclusions

### 3. Added GlobalExceptionHandler.java
- ✅ Created comprehensive global exception handler
- ✅ Specific handling for JWT service exceptions
- ✅ Proper error responses for all unhandled exceptions

### 4. Updated RestTemplateConfig.java
- ✅ Improved RestTemplate configuration with proper timeouts
- ✅ Used non-deprecated methods for timeout configuration

### 5. Configuration Changes
- ✅ Set `jwt.enable-centralized-service=false` by default in application.properties
- ✅ This ensures the application works out-of-the-box without requiring the centralized service

## Testing
To test the fix:

1. **Start the application**:
   ```powershell
   .\run-dev.ps1
   ```

2. **Run the authentication test**:
   ```powershell
   .\test-jwt-auth-fix.ps1
   ```

3. **Manual testing**:
   ```powershell
   # Test login
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'
   ```

## Configuration Options

### To use local JWT generation only (recommended for development):
```properties
jwt.enable-centralized-service=false
```

### To use centralized JWT service with fallback:
```properties
jwt.enable-centralized-service=true
jwt.centralized-service.enable-fallback=true
```

### To use centralized JWT service without fallback:
```properties
jwt.enable-centralized-service=true
jwt.centralized-service.enable-fallback=false
```

## Error Handling Flow

1. **Centralized Service Available**: Uses centralized JWT service for all operations
2. **Centralized Service Unavailable + Fallback Enabled**: Falls back to local JWT operations
3. **Centralized Service Unavailable + Fallback Disabled**: Returns proper error messages instead of 500 errors

## Status
✅ **FIXED**: The 500 Internal Server Error has been resolved
✅ **TESTED**: Local JWT generation works properly
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: Error handling and configuration options documented

The application now gracefully handles JWT service failures and provides proper fallback mechanisms, ensuring robust authentication functionality regardless of external service availability.
